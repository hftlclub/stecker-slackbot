@book{GruensteinConversationalInterfaces2009,
  title = {Conversational {{Interfaces}}},
  abstract = {Multimodal conversational interfaces, which allow humans to interact with a computer using a combination of spoken natural language and a graphical interface, offer the potential to transform the manner by which humans communicate with computers. While researchers have developed myriad such interfaces, none have made the transition out of the laboratory and into the hands of a significant number of users. This thesis makes progress toward overcoming two intertwined barriers preventing more widespread adoption: availability and usability. Toward addressing the problem of availability, this thesis introduces a new platform for building multimodal interfaces that makes it easy to deploy them to users via the World Wide Web. One consequence of this work is City Browser, the first multimodal conversational interface made publicly available to anyone with a web browser and a microphone. City Browser serves as a proof-of-concept that significant amounts of usage data can be collected in this way, allowing a glimpse of how users interact with such interfaces outside of a laboratory environment.},

In this paper, we introduce the nature of these conversational interfaces and describe the underlying human language technologies on which they are based. After summarizing some of the recent progress in this area around the world, we discuss development issues faced by researchers creating these kinds of systems and present some of the ongoing and unmet research challenges in this field.},
